Hi Catherine!

Here are some things I thought you might enjoy doing today.

* A Flutter Challenge: [Can you make this app?](https://medium.com/fluttery/introducing-flutter-challenges-c72d4b6e005d)
* You could also try making [this book app](https://flutterweekly.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c8d8d18b6e2c6316ddc1d48a0&id=dd67567545&e=0562da2f5d) if you want to follow along with a video
* You could watch this cool video of [Firebat trying a quirky Mage deck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLkbbLpn5Sc)
* Maths! Look in the basket...
* Learn Python, the easiest language there is. You can try [here](https://www.learnpython.org/) or maybe [some of these cool project ideas](https://github.com/karan/Projects)
